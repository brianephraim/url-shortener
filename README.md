## Linting/Prettier

A number of linting modules are active to ensure code quality and performance.

Code can be tidied up by running  
`npm run prettier`

Prettier will not solve linting issues.  See linting problems by running
`npm run lint`


## Problem building ios with `npm run ios` ?

Do you use `nvm`?  Try `nvm unalias default`
